/**
 * Redraws the wordmark on covers whose raw art is already on disk.
 *
 * Typography is the part of a cover most likely to want another pass, and a
 * generated picture that was already correct should not be paid for twice to
 * move a line of type. Covers generated after this existed keep their untouched
 * art beside them as `<key>.raw.png`; this reads those and re-runs only the
 * compositing step.
