/**
 * What is localizable, where it lives, and how much care it needs.
 *
 *   npm run fr:manifest            # the table
 *   npm run fr:manifest -- --json  # the manifest itself
 *   npm run fr:manifest -- --world=story_hush_house
 *
 * ## Why tiers
 *
 * Twenty-three worlds carry roughly 46,000 words of authored prose, and
 * treating every sentence as literature is how a localization takes a year.
 * But the answer is not to lower the bar — it is to notice that the source
 * contains three genuinely different kinds of content:
 *
 *   **A — style-bearing.** Changing the wording changes how the French game
 *   *sounds*. A hook, an opening, a `speechStyle`, a `voiceSample`. These are
 *   written in French by somebody asking "how would a French writer have put
 *   this if English had never existed".
 *
 *   **B — semantic.** The model needs to know what it means; the exact phrasing
 *   does not shape any voice. A secret, a motivation, a chronology, an ability's
 *   mechanics. Accurate, idiomatic, unfussy.
 *
 *   **C — language-neutral.** Ids, enums, thresholds, asset keys — and
 *   `artDirection`, which is a prompt for an image model trained on English.
 *   Translating these is parity theatre.
 *
 * The classifier is **by path**, not by content, because a field's job is a
 * property of where it sits in the schema rather than of what happens to be in
 * it today. `hiddenDrives` is B whatever it says.
 *
 * ## The one rule that decides a hard case
 *
 * A field is not B merely because the player never sees it. If its wording
 * conditions how characters speak, how prose sounds, or how choices are
 * written, it is A. `speechStyle` is invisible and is the most A field in the
 * catalogue.
