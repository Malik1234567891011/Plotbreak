/**
 * Which French now describes a world that has moved.
 *
 *   npm run fr:stale
 *   npm run fr:stale -- --world=story_hush_house
 *
 * English is not finished and will not be. Every time a premise is sharpened or
 * a voice is retuned, the French written from the old version quietly becomes
 * wrong — and nothing about it looks wrong. The file is still French, still
 * grammatical, still in the right place. It just no longer says what the world
 * says.
 *
 * So every entry in an overlay carries the hash of the English it was written
 * from, in a comment above it. This compares those against the English as it is
 * now. It reports three things:
 *
 *   **STALE**   — the English changed. The French needs redoing.
 *   **ORPHAN**  — the path no longer exists. The French is describing something
 *                 that was deleted.
 *   **MISSING** — English prose with no French at all. Coverage, not rot.
 *
 * Run it before a release and after any English content change.
