 * - **Reassuring, not technical.** Several of these exist to say *nothing has
 *   been lost*. The reassurance is the message and the diagnosis is incidental,
 *   so a faithful-but-clinical French rendering ("Erreur réseau") is a
 *   mistranslation even when every word in it is correct.
 * - **No apology, and no blame.** None of these say "sorry" and none of them
 *   tell the player they did something wrong; they say what happened and what
 *   to do next. French should not acquire either.
 *
 * The keys are stable and the values are the fallback: `ApiError` and
 * `AuthError` translate at the point they are constructed, through a translator
 * the store binds to the interface language.
