/**
 * WL-01 / WL-02 / WL-03 — the wallet, the store, and every store error.
 *
 * Two namespaces live here because they are one surface to a player. `wallet.*`
 * is the screen; `store.*` is what StoreKit and Play Billing come back with,
 * raised in `apps/mobile/src/store/purchases.ts` and rendered by the same
 * screen. Splitting them across two files would mean a purchase failure and the
 * notice that shows it were translated by two people.
 *
 * **This is the money screen, so the English here is frozen harder than
 * anywhere else.** Every value is the exact string the app shipped, including
 * the places where English never inflected a plural (`1 credits added.`). Those
 * are keyed as ICU plurals with identical `one` and `other` forms — the
 * category exists so French can say `1 crédit` / `2 crédits`, not so English
 * can be quietly corrected. Fixing the English copy while translating it is an
 * English regression wearing a refactor, and on this screen it is a money bug.
 *
 * Nothing here formats a number. `formatCredits(…)`, `toLocaleString()` and
 * `toFixed(2)` all still happen in the screen and arrive as ready-made strings,
 * so `#` never appears in a plural: `#` would apply ICU grouping and silently
 * change what the app renders (see UI_AUDIT §2.3 — Hermes ships without full
 * ICU, so `toLocaleString()` and ICU do not agree on a device). Locale-aware
 * number and currency formatting is a separate step and owns those call sites.
