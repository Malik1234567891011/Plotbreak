/**
 * CS-01 / CS-02 — character setup.
 *
 * Two things about this screen are unlike the rest of the catalogue.
 *
 * **The placeholders are writing, not labels.** `e.g. I ran messages for the
 * lower-city courts until someone noticed I could read the seals.` is teaching
 * the player how to answer, by example, in the register the game is written in.
 * Translated word-for-word it becomes an instruction; the French has to be
 * *written*, in French, doing the same job. It is the first prose a French
 * player reads in the product.
 *
 * **The grammar question is French-only.** `setup.grammar.*` has no English
 * rendering because English never asks it — see `fr/setup.ts` and
 * `PLAYER_GRAMMAR.md`. The English values here exist so the keys typecheck and
 * so an English build that somehow reached them shows something sane, not
 * because the question belongs on the English screen.
