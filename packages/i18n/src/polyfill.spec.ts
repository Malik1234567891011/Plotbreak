/**
 * Only the `Intl` this package actually installs may be used.
 *
 * `polyfill.ts` force-installs five areas: getCanonicalLocales, Locale,
 * PluralRules, NumberFormat, DateTimeFormat and ListFormat. Anything else in
 * `Intl` is whatever the engine happens to ship, and on Hermes that is a
 * gamble the app loses badly: `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` in `Comments.tsx`
 * **segfaulted the app** every time a player opened a story from Discover. The
 * crash surfaced as a SIGSEGV inside React Native's mounting transaction with
 * no JS error, which cost a long bisect to trace back to one line.
 *
 * `search.ts` shows the alternative: it builds an `Intl.Collator` inside a
 * try/catch, probes it against the two cases it needs, and falls back to
 * ordinary string comparison when the engine's version is not trustworthy.
 * Unpolyfilled `Intl` is allowed there precisely because it is guarded.
 *
 * The React Native client this was written for is gone — the app is Swift and
 * uses Foundation's own formatters, which carry no such hazard. What is left to
 * guard is this package, which the API and the engine both import, and which a
 * future JS client would inherit whole. The rule is cheap and the crash it
 * caught was expensive, so it stays.
