/**
 * Clarity for a decision, as distinct from clarity for a story.
 *
 * `narrative-clarity.ts` governs prose the player reads. This governs copy the
 * player has to *act* on, and the standard is different: a premise may withhold
 * why something happened, but a build screen may not withhold what the options
 * are. Mystery is a story device. On a choice screen it is just a worse screen.
 *
 * The bar is the five questions a player with no context must be able to
 * answer before they are asked to commit:
 *
 *   1. What am I choosing?
 *   2. How are these options different from each other?
 *   3. What kind of character does each one make?
 *   4. Can I change it later?
 *   5. What does it actually do in play?
 *
 * Deliberately not a style guide. It does not object to invented words, poetry
 * or voice — only to those being the *only* place the meaning lives.
