/**
 * The screenshot that started this.
 *
 * The player was offered "Ask Dai about the five." They selected it. It appeared
 * correctly in the transcript as what they did. And then the *next* scene
 * offered "Ask Dai about the five." again, next to "Guard him — Jun" — so the
 * screen read as two authored tasks with one ticked off.
 *
 * Nothing was stale: the client replaces the array each turn and hides the
 * cards while a turn resolves. The card came back because it is generated from
 * standing affordances — Dai is present, so `Ask ${present[0]} about
 * ${topics[0]}` renders again, identically, forever.
