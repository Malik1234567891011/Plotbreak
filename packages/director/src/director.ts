  // What counts as worth a frame.
  //
  // This list used to be REVEAL, CRITICAL_SUCCESS, ENCOUNTER_START and
  // QUEST_TRANSITION — every term a combat or quest event. Nine Weeks generates
  // none of them, ever, so in a romance or slice-of-life world the *only* road
  // to an image was `landmark`, which there reduces to "you walked into a new
  // room" or "you met somebody new". Once the player had seen the four
  // locations and met the cast, the world could never show them another
  // picture. It was not a gate that was slightly too tight; it was a gate with
  // no term a conversation world could satisfy.
  //
  // So: the events a *social* story is made of count too. Somebody's feeling
  // about you changing is that story's ENCOUNTER_START, and a refusal is its
  // boss fight — "real rejection" is a thing Nine Weeks promises on its own
  // world sheet. A visible change of expression counts as well: if the stage is
  // about to swap somebody's face, that is by definition a beat with a face in
  // it worth looking at. (`COMPLICATION` is this engine's other failure
  // outcome; there is no CRITICAL_FAILURE.)
