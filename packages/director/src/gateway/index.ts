 * Spec §31.4 — the gateway is chosen by environment, never by business logic.
 * With no key configured the product runs the rule-based pipeline, which is a
 * first-class mode rather than a degraded one: the engine is identical and every
 * turn is still deterministic and auditable.
 *
 * `MODEL_PROVIDER` pins the choice when both keys are present. Otherwise
 * whichever key exists wins, so configuring one key is all it takes — a key
 * sitting in the environment being quietly ignored is worse than no key at all.
