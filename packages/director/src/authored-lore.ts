/**
 * The world's own knowledge, made retrievable.
 *
 * Retrieval starts empty. Every fact in a session is one the *player* created —
 * a promise made, a door opened, somebody hit — and nothing the author wrote
 * was ever in the index at all. So a world could describe the Ninth Fleet as
 * "the navy of the coastal kingdoms, who set the bounties, own the charts, and
 * one of whose blades killed Ferro Vane", and when the player asked what the
 * Ninth Fleet was, the writer improvised, because that sentence lived in a
 * field nothing read at runtime.
 *
 * What reached the model was the current room, the people standing in it, and
 * four to six lines of hard canon. Everything else the author wrote about the
 * world — every other place, every faction, every person not in the room, what
 * the techniques are and what the relics do — was invisible.
 *
 * This is the same idea as a keyword book, built out of what the world already
 * has rather than a second thing to author. Derived per turn from the
 * StoryVersion rather than seeded into storage: nothing to migrate, nothing to
 * fall out of sync, and a published story that gets edited is immediately
 * correct in every session running it.
 *
 * Retrieved on its own small budget rather than sharing the session's, because
 * lore that crowds out what happened two turns ago is worse than no lore.
