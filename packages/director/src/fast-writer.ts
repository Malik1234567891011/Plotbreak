/**
 * Spec §17.10 — prose that arrives while it is being written.
 *
 * The autopsy that produced this: an ordinary turn cost three serial model
 * calls before a single word reached the player — parse 2350ms, director
 * 2368ms, writer 2219ms — plus a 1900ms accept round-trip, for a median of
 * 12.6 seconds to first readable text. The engine, the thing this whole
 * architecture was built around, took two milliseconds.
 *
 * The writer is the only one of those three that has to happen before prose
 * exists. And it does not have to *finish* before prose exists: it only has to
 * start.
 *
 * So this writes plain prose rather than a JSON document, and flushes it a
 * sentence at a time. A player reading the first sentence at a second and a
 * half is in a different product from one watching a spinner for twelve.
 *
 * The structured world data — memory proposals, media decisions, state deltas
 * — never came from the writer anyway. It comes from the engine and the
 * director, and it can finish after the player has started reading.
