/**
 * Three things the player could say next.
 *
 * The old model was an affordance list. `buildOpportunities` returns everything
 * currently *possible* — who is in the room, where the exits go, which abilities
 * are affordable — and `buildSuggestions` rendered the first of each into a
 * label: `Ask ${presentCharacters[0]} about ${topics[0]}`. That is a pure
 * function of the scene, with no memory of the turn that just happened, so
 * "Ask Dai about the five." regenerated verbatim on the turn immediately after
 * the player asked Dai about the five.
 *
 * Nothing was stale and nothing was carried forward. The card came back because
 * Dai was still standing there. But the effect on screen is a checklist — two
 * authored tasks, one ticked, one outstanding — and that is most of why
 * ordinary play read as a quest system rather than a story.
 *
 * So these are generated *after* the beat is written, from what the beat
 * actually says. They are the protagonist's own words, in first person, with an
 * action and usually a line of dialogue, and they are three genuinely different
 * attitudes rather than three different quest branches.
 *
 * Latency: this runs after the prose has finished streaming, so it is off the
 * first-text path entirely. The player is already reading when it starts.
