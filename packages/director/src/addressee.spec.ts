/**
 * A room with three people in it and a line that names none of them.
 *
 * From the 25-turn Nine Weeks run. The response cards are first-person prose —
 * "I lean back, arms crossed with a smirk. 'So it's pancakes and swims, huh?
 * Sounds like you're dodging the juicy stuff.'" — and the addressee fallback
 * was `present(spoken) ?? present(raw) ?? soleCompanion`. With Juno, Cass and
 * Nadia at the bar, all three failed: the line names nobody, and there is no
 * *sole* companion. So no speech action was created, nobody was obliged to
 * answer, and the beat came back as the player talking to a room.
