 * `tu` or `vous`, per ordered pair. Step 9.

 * The single loudest signal that a French text was written in French. English
 * has no second person to get wrong, so nothing here has an English half and
 * nothing here runs in an English session — but in French, every line of
 * dialogue picks one, and picking the wrong one is the difference between a
 * character who knows you and a character who is reading from a form.
 *
 * Two things had to be true for this to be worth building:
 *
 * 1. It must not drift between the two model stages. So it is projected in
 *    `speaker-brief.ts`, which exists for exactly that reason, and both the
 *    streaming writer and the structured one read it from there.
 * 2. It must be *authorable*. A rule cannot know that Nine Weeks is a summer
 *    job where everybody is nineteen and Window Seven is a professional pairing
 *    where the switch is the whole arc. `CharacterDef.addressMode` is how a
 *    world says so; this file is what happens when it does not.
 *
 * See `DIALOGUE_AND_REGISTER.md` §2.2–2.4.
