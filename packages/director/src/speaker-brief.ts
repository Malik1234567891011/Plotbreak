/**
 * Everything the authored world knows about a person in the room, in the shape
 * the model stages consume.
 *
 * This exists because of a gap found by playing, not by reading schemas. The
 * launch worlds author their cast to a standard well beyond what the runtime
 * was using: Kai Sumire has a role, three public traits, a hidden drive, two
 * values, a fear ("Being the reason"), a social style ("Apologises first, then
 * says the smart thing"), a boundary ("Do not shout at him in front of
 * people"), two goals, a secret with a reveal hint, four topics, and three
 * voice samples.
 *
 * The writer — the stage that produces the actual words — was given his name,
 * his pronouns, his speech style, his voice samples, and a relationship
 * summary. Not one thing he wants, fears, values or would refuse. The director
 * got three of those fields and the writer got none, so characters were
 * *voiced* correctly and *motivated* not at all, which is precisely how a cast
 * ends up sounding interchangeable however good the individual lines are.
 *
 * One projection, used by both stages, so they cannot drift apart again.
