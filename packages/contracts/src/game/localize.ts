/**
 * A world, in another language.
 *
 * ## Why an overlay rather than a second fixture
 *
 * A parallel `nine-weeks.fr.ts` would duplicate every id, every number, every
 * connection, every DC and every asset key — thousands of lines that must stay
 * byte-identical to the English file forever, with nothing but discipline
 * keeping them so. The first time somebody adds a location to one and not the
 * other, the French world quietly becomes a different world.
 *
 * An overlay carries **only the prose**, addressed by path. What is absent
 * falls back to English, which is the correct intermediate state and is visible
 * rather than silent — `npm run fr:worlds` counts it.
 *
 * ## What is not here, on purpose
 *
 * `STORY_AUDIT.md` §2 is the authority, and three of its rules are easy to get
 * wrong:
 *
 * - **Names never travel.** Not characters, not locations, not items. `Juno
 *   Vale` is `Juno Vale` in Paris, and a translated proper noun is how a world
 *   stops being the same world.
 * - **`artDirection` stays English.** It is a prompt for an image model, not
 *   prose for a reader, and the models are trained on English.
 * - **`affordances` are parser-matched phrases**, so translating an ability's
 *   name while leaving them makes the ability unreachable. They move together
 *   or not at all.
