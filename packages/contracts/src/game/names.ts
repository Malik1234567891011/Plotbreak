/**
 * What to call somebody in one word.
 *
 * Ten places shortened a name by taking the first word of it, which is right
 * for "Dai Okonkwo" and wrong for every character whose name carries a title.
 * Blackwake's Captain Veyra Sol was "Captain" in the state-delta chips
 * ("Captain is afraid of you"), in the suggested actions ("Take the deck —
 * Captain"), and in the writer's witness lines. Last Five's Coach Torakawa was
 * "Coach". Two captains in one scene were both "Captain".
 *
 * It is also a matching bug and not only a display one: the parser and the
 * entity resolver index characters by that same first word, so a player typing
 * "Veyra" — the name the prose itself uses — was resolving to nobody.
 */

/**
 * Titles that are not a name.
 *
 * Deliberately short and English-only. A world may legitimately name somebody
 * "The Quiet One", where the whole string is the name, so anything that would
 * consume every word falls back to the full name rather than to nothing.
