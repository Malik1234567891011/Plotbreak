/**
 * What the player gets for playing.
 *
 * Definitions live in code rather than in a table because they are content:
 * they ship with releases, they need types, and an unlock condition is a
 * predicate, not a row. The database holds only what is true of a *person* —
 * progress, unlocked, claimed.
 *
 * ## What these deliberately do not reward
 *
 * Nothing here pays for spending money, for buying credits, for following
 * anybody, or for publishing. Those are the achievements that turn a product
 * into a chore list, and two of them describe features we have not built. Every
 * badge below says the same thing in a different way: **play more, go further,
 * try something else**.
 *
 * ## Why the rewards are small
 *
 * A VIVID turn costs 60. The set pays 2,150 — about thirty-six turns, spread
 * across behaviour that takes days to produce, and 1,000 of it is one badge:
 * `twenty_turns`, which exists to get somebody past the point where they know
 * whether they like this.
 *
 * The rest stay small on purpose. A reward large enough to substitute for the
 * economy stops being a reward and becomes the price, so the subsidy is spent
 * once, early, on the only thing worth buying — a second session.
