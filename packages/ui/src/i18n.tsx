 * The design system's translator.

 * `packages/ui` cannot reach the app's store — it is a library, and the app
 * depends on it rather than the other way round — so the locale is handed in
 * through a context that the app mounts once. This file exists so that
 * `components.tsx` needs only a mechanical `'Save'` → `{t('ui.save')}` edit and
 * no new plumbing of its own: that file is the active conflict surface and its
 * diff has to stay easy to rebase.
 *
 * The default is English rather than a throw. A design-system component
 * rendered in a test, a storybook, or a screen mounted above the provider
 * should draw the label it has always drawn, not crash.
