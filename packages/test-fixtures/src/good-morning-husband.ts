/**
 * "Good Morning, Husband" — a marriage that already happened.
 *
 * The structural bet is the opposite of every romance world we have: there is
 * no courtship, no cast to choose between, and no meter to fill. The
 * relationship starts at four years deep, with history, routines, in-jokes and
 * a shared grocery list in two handwritings. What the player is doing is not
 * winning somebody over. It is deciding whether to keep a life somebody else
 * built, and finding out what that person is actually like while they decide.
 *
 * Which means the whole thing rests on Hana being a person rather than a
 * reward. She has a job she likes, a fellowship she has not mentioned, a
 * brother, a best friend who is on her side rather than the player's, and a
 * limit: she will not be managed. Every one of those is authored so the writer
 * can motivate her rather than only voice her. "Avoid relentless perfect-wife
 * sycophancy" is a note in the bible, and a note is not a mechanism — what
 * stops it is that she wants a specific thing this week and it costs the player
 * something to give it to her.
 *
 * The memory gap is a device and not a plot. If the player never pulls on it,
 * Platform 11 does not exist: the lead is gated behind a flag only somebody who
 * went looking can set, and the ordinary Saturday is the whole game. Thirty
 * turns of breakfast, laundry and one argument about a spare room is a
 * legitimate way to play this and should be good.
 *
 * Three variables. Energy exists because `resolveRest` restores GOOD_HIGH
 * resources and a world with none prints "you rest, and recover" and changes
 * nothing — and because a Saturday genuinely runs out. The other two are
 * descending on purpose: a marriage is not a bar you fill, it is a pair of
 * things that get worse if nobody attends to them.

  hook: 'You wake up on an ordinary Saturday wearing a wedding ring, in a flat you have never seen, and the woman making pancakes in the kitchen has been your wife for four years.',
  premise:
    'You go to sleep in your own life and wake up in this one. Same body, same name, same memory of being a child. What is missing is the last several years, and in those years you apparently got married.\n\n' +
    'There is a gold band on your left hand that does not come off easily, because it has been there long enough for your finger to have grown around it.\n\n' +
    'There is a framed photograph on the dresser of you and a woman outside a registry office, both laughing at something outside the frame. Her name is Hana Mori. The calendar in the hall says four years.\n\n' +
    'Nothing dramatic happened last night. No accident, no hospital, no bang on the head. You simply went to sleep somewhere else.\n\n' +
    'She does not know anything is wrong. When you tell her she will assume you are joking, because that is the kind of thing the two of you do to each other.\n\n' +
    'So you have a marriage you did not build, a flat full of evidence about a man you have to take on trust, and a wife who will notice within a day that you are reading her like a stranger.\n\n' +
    'What you do about that is yours. Tell her. Play along until it stops being playing. Keep this life and make it better than the one you lost, or go and find out what happened and lose this one working it out.\n\n' +
    'She has a secret of her own, and hers has a deadline.',
