/**
 * "The Blank Prophecy" — Athens, and a person the machinery cannot read.
 *
 * The bible's hard canon is one sentence long: the Loom cannot currently read
 * the player. Everything else about the blank — why, what caused it, whether
 * it can be undone — is explicitly open, so nothing in this world commits to
 * an explanation and the setup field invites the player to supply one.
 *
 * Blank is freedom, not invincibility, and the world is built so both halves
 * bite. Prophecy cannot predict them and fate-based protection also fails on
 * them; oracles cannot reassure them; and the things that eat threads are
 * drawn to the hole where theirs should be. That last one is the Fray, which
 * is the price of every divine power used by somebody with nothing to anchor
 * it to.
 *
 * Gods are characters here rather than vending machines, so only two of them
 * are authored — the one who turns up because he is curious and the one whose
 * whole domain is the place between things. The rest of Olympus is an
 * institution, felt through Notice.
 *
 * Three variables. Footing is the only GOOD_HIGH, because `resolveRest`
 * refills those. Notice is first among the descending pair — the generic cost
 * path and PUBLIC_VIOLENCE both take the first GOOD_LOW in array order, and a
 * mythic event in a crowded street bringing Olympus round to look is exactly
 * what should absorb that.
