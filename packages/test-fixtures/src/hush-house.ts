/**
 * "Hush House" — a boarding house that rehearses the people who live in it.
 *
 * The horror rule this world is built on is the one from the bible: the player
 * must always know WHAT happened, and is allowed not to know WHY. So every
 * phenomenon here is a checkable, physical event — a door, a light, a floor
 * number, a voice using a word slightly wrong — and none of them is a mood.
 * "Something is not right in the hallway" is the failure mode; "the light
 * outside 309 is red and it was not red four minutes ago" is the world.
 *
 * The other structural bet: ordinary life is the point. Breakfast, rent,
 * convenience-store runs and being bad at flirting are not filler between
 * hauntings, they are the thing the hauntings are worth something against, so
 * the schedules put people in the kitchen at three in the morning and the
 * openings are domestic.
 *
 * Two variables, both invisible, both banded. Ayame's trust is deliberately NOT
 * one of them — the relationship system already models what she will and will
 * not say, and a second copy of it as a resource would drift within a week.
 * What is left is what relationships cannot express: how much of the player the
 * building has, and what the city outside thinks of them.

    'Your neighbour in 314 is Ayame Kurose: twenty-two, dryly funny, visibly not sleeping. On your first evening she hands you a canned coffee and gives you three rules as casually as somebody explaining the bins.\n\n' +
    'If the hallway light outside 309 turns red, do not look through the peephole. If the lift opens onto a floor labelled 0, do not step out. If somebody knocks at 2:13 in the morning and says they are Ayame, do not open it. She will never knock at that time. She promises.\n\n' +
    'What breaking one costs is written down nowhere. The tenant who had 312 before you found out on a Thursday in March, and his name is still on the mailbox.\n\n' +
    'Her older sister disappeared from this building four years ago. The police wrote it up as a runaway. Ayame moved in to prove otherwise, she has seen Mika twice since, and she is not going to lose her a second time.\n\n' +
    'The rent is due on the first and you need somewhere to live. Everything else here is a thing you find out.',

  /**
   * Three, all invisible, all described as behaviour.
   *
   * Ayame's trust is not here on purpose: `startingRelationship` and her gates
   * already say what she will and will not tell you, and a resource that
   * duplicates a relationship dimension is a second source of truth about the
   * same person. What is left is the pressures no relationship can carry — how
   * much of the player the building has collected, what the city has decided
   * the player is, and how long they have been awake.
   *
   * Sleep is here for a reason that is half fiction and half engine. The
   * fiction: everybody in this building is tired, and the horror of the place
   * is that being tired is how it gets in. The engine: `resolveRest` restores
   * every GOOD_HIGH resource and a world with none printed "you rest, and
   * recover" while changing nothing, and the generic cost path spends a
   * GOOD_HIGH first and otherwise raises the first descending resource it
   * finds — so with no Sleep, every unpriced cost in the game was landing on
   * House Attention, including being seen fighting in the street.
   *
   * Which is also why the order below is not arbitrary. `PUBLIC_VIOLENCE`
   * takes the first GOOD_LOW resource in this array, and something the street
   * saw belongs to Public Suspicion, not to the house.
