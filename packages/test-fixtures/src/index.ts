/**
 * These three shipped with null asset keys on purpose, and no longer need to.
 *
 * `withDerivedAssetKeys` fills in the key the image pipeline *would* produce,
 * which is right for a world whose art exists and wrong for one whose art has
 * not been commissioned: the story would declare a cover, the catalog would ask
 * for it, and every card would show a hole. So they carried null keys "until
 * somebody runs the generator for them on purpose" — which has now happened,
 * 180 assets across the three, so they join the rest.
 *
 * Worth keeping in mind next time: the gap between generating a world's art and
 * wrapping it here is invisible everywhere except a screenshot, which is
 * exactly what `derive-assets.ts` says it wanted to design out. `catalog.spec`
 * now checks the pair rather than trusting it.

/**
 * The official launch catalog.
 *
 * Deliberately different spines, so the engine is exercised rather than
 * decorated: The Ninth Archive is investigation with fail-forward defeat, The
 * Understudy is pure social systems with no combat at all, The Salt Road is
 * travel arithmetic with permanent death, and The Tidewall is a class RPG where
 * the class picks the route through every door, and The Unbound is build
 * freedom where half the abilities are awakened rather than chosen, and Nine
 * Weeks is a romance with no combat at all where the romance can genuinely fail,
 * and Red Moon Brigade is a monster hunt where the meter that makes you strong
 * is the same one that stops you being a person, and Seven Days to Midnight is
 * a week that restarts where the only thing you keep is what you found out, and
 * Blackwake is an ocean where the crew are people who can leave, and Last Five
 * is a sport where your position is counted out of what you kept trying and
 * every rival who watches film makes it harder, and Hush House is a building
 * that has spent a hundred years learning how people behave and gets better at
 * imitating the ones you let matter to you, and Window Seven is seven nights at
 * a camera where the brief is the thing every route through the story breaks, and
 * Good Morning, Husband is a marriage that already has four years of history in
 * it on the morning the player arrives with none, and Itachi is a fortnight in
 * which a thirteen-year-old is the only channel between two organisations that
 * have each decided he is theirs, and the famous thing at the end of it is one
 * of twelve destinations rather than the shape of the world, and Primal Crown is
 * three days at a market where five peoples have to redraw a forty-year
 * arrangement before the herds arrive, and the animals in it are animals, and
 * Zero Throne is a machine that opened for nobody for eighteen years walking the
 * length of a memorial plaza on turn one and kneeling to somebody who has no
 * idea why, and The Fourth Beast is three small creatures in open habitats under
 * a Paris institute, of which you are choosing one and somebody else is getting
 * whichever you leave, and Seven Names is a list handed to a condemned prisoner
 * six hours before the execution, by a man who says the first thing to understand
 * about it is that a name on a list is not a person who deserves to die, and The Blank Prophecy is a world that decides who everybody is
 * going to be by reading a thread, and a person it read and found nothing on, and The Red Floor is a storage level under an ageing gym where
 * fighters from every discipline meet after midnight and nothing that happens
 * down there has ever been written down, and Second Skin is a world where everybody chooses which animal
 * they become at sixteen and keeps it for life, and a woman who has done it twice
 * comes through the ceremony window, and Last Service is a thirty-seat family
 * restaurant with thirty days left on a loan and a hood that is making a noise, and Pink Tide is seven nights at an adults-only
 * island resort where a guest checked out this morning without leaving, and Ace is ten years old on a mountain
 * with a brother he has not agreed to and a decade in which nothing famous has
 * happened yet, and Light is a bored seventeen-year-old in the last twenty
 * minutes of a Wednesday, watching a notebook land in the school grounds.
