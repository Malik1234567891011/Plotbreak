/**
 * "Window Seven" — seven nights in a room with one other person and a view.
 *
 * The genre problem this world exists to solve is that surveillance is, on
 * paper, the least playable thing in fiction: two people sit still and nothing
 * happens. What makes it work is that the room is small, the partner is
 * excellent, and the target knows. So the authored content is weighted almost
 * entirely toward the inside of Apartment 7C — what is in the cupboards, what
 * Mara does at four in the morning, which mug is whose — and the espionage is
 * something that happens to that room rather than somewhere the player goes.
 *
 * The player can, of course, leave on the first night, ring the target, open
 * the case, or defect. The world is built to survive all of those: the seven
 * nights are a clock, not a corridor, and every one of them fires whether the
 * player is in the flat or not.
 *
 * One banded variable. Mara's trust and Selene's alignment are relationships
 * and are modelled as relationships; what neither of those can carry is what
 * the institution has decided about the player, which is the thing that
 * escalates on its own.

  premise:
    'For seven nights you sit in a dark flat on the sixth floor of an ordinary city apartment block and watch the penthouse that takes up the whole top floor of the building across the road.\n\n' +
    'The job has four rules and they fit on one line. Log every visitor. File your report at six in the morning. Do not leave the flat. Make no contact with the woman who lives over there.\n\n' +
    'Her name is Dr Selene Voss. She is a cybernetics researcher and a policy adviser, and the file your service keeps on her says she has been selling defence data out of the ministry for eleven months.\n\n' +
    'Your partner is Mara Ellison, who has done four of these and organises the safehouse food by expiry date.\n\n' +
    'There is a black case in the wardrobe. It is hers. You are not to open it.\n\n' +
    'At 01:16 on the first night, Voss walks out onto her balcony in a white shirt, looks across four lanes of empty road directly into a lens she has no way of knowing about, and waves.\n\n' +
    'Ninety seconds later your handset takes four words from somebody calling themselves Glass.\n\n' +
    'YOU ARE WATCHING THE WRONG APARTMENT.\n\n' +
    'So either the target knows exactly where you are sitting, or somebody inside your own service wanted you in this particular room. Six nights left to work out which, and the service does not officially exist, which means nobody is coming if you are wrong.',

   * briefed and never found out what it was for, and it is a perfectly good
   * ending. "Mara's Order" is the same night from her side, and it can land
   * with the player having never worked out what was in the case.
