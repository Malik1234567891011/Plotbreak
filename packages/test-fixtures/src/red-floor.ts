/**
 * "The Red Floor" — a storage level under a gym, and nothing that happens on
 * it has ever been written down.
 *
 * The bible's argument is that the room works precisely because there are no
 * cameras: a world champion can be dropped down there and still be world
 * champion in the morning, which is what lets people find out what they
 * actually are without it costing them a career. So the world is built around
 * that protection being fragile — Attention is the meter that ends the Red
 * Floor, and it is what public violence feeds.
 *
 * The moral centre is not the fighting. It is Maki, who twenty years ago
 * believed a boxer could still win, argued the doctor out of a stoppage, got
 * one more round, and has never once said the sport did it. Damage is
 * therefore a real accumulating variable with a doctor attached to it, and
 * "One More Round" is an authored destination rather than a warning.
 *
 * Not everybody's arc is greatness, and the world refuses to imply otherwise.
 * Koji has lost a great deal, will probably never be champion, loves this
 * anyway, and has an ending of his own that is not a consolation prize.
 *
 * Three variables. Gas is the only GOOD_HIGH — `resolveRest` refills those and
 * cardio is exactly what sleep and a week off give back. Attention is first
 * among the descending pair because the generic cost path and PUBLIC_VIOLENCE
 * both take the first GOOD_LOW in array order, and a fight outside the room
 * bringing commissions and press down on the room is the correct consequence.
