/**
 * "Pink Tide" — Aster Cove, seven nights, and a guest who checked out without
 * leaving.
 *
 * The bible's north star is tonal and it is the thing most likely to break:
 * **the resort has to stay genuinely desirable while something is wrong.** A
 * world that turns grim has thrown away its own premise, and a world whose
 * mystery never bites is a brochure. So the two are built to occupy the same
 * scenes rather than alternate — flirting with somebody who is watching a
 * manager over your shoulder, looking under a cabana while a waiter keeps
 * bringing drinks, pancakes the morning after the worst night of the week.
 *
 * The span is the stay: day one at 14:17 by the infinity pool through the
 * seventh morning at the ferry. Everything before it is fact the world already
 * knows — Adrian's five days, the fall, the cover-up, and a shipment of
 * solvent barrels put into the sea caves eight years ago — and everything
 * after it is epilogue. The clock is a day at a resort, so a run that never
 * investigates still has somewhere to be at four in the afternoon.
 *
 * Three variables, and Ease is the only GOOD_HIGH because the vacation is the
 * resource: sun, sleep, a long lunch, an afternoon that nobody needs anything
 * from you for. Every investigating ability spends it, which is the mechanical
 * version of the design rule — chasing this costs you the week you paid for.
 * Heat is first among the descending pair (the generic cost path and
 * PUBLIC_VIOLENCE both take the first GOOD_LOW in array order, and management
 * noticing you is exactly the right consequence for a scene at a pool), and
 * Tab is the resort's own pressure: everything here can be put on the room,
 * and the number is waiting at checkout.
 *
 * Adrian is a CharacterDef rather than a quest object because he is alive on a
 * ledge for most of the week and has to be able to talk when he is found —
 * furious, self-justifying, and not a pure hero. Detective Nishimura is not
 * one: she arrives through world events and quest routes, and giving her
 * voiceSamples would make the police a companion rather than a consequence.
 *
 * BLANK protagonist. An adult on holiday inventing themselves for a week is
 * the premise's own subject, and section 61 of the bible is explicit about it:
 * what do people become when nobody from their real life is watching.

  hook: 'You came to Aster Cove for seven nights of sun. Forty minutes after check-in, the pink-haired host who splashed you at the pool tells you a guest has been missing for three days and management insists he checked out this morning.',
  premise:
    'Aster Cove is an adults-only resort island forty minutes by fast ferry from the southern Japanese coast, and at 2:17 in the afternoon the white stone around its infinity pool is hot enough to hurt.\n\n' +
    'You have been here forty minutes. You have not unpacked. The water is the colour the brochure promised, there is music coming off the beach club, and somebody in the shallow end has just splashed you on purpose.\n\n' +
    'Her name is Sora, her hair is bubblegum pink, and she has decided your vacation posture is unacceptable.\n\n' +
    'Twenty minutes later, after a drink you did not order and a swim you did not plan, her smile drops for exactly one second as an assistant manager crosses the deck behind you.\n\n' +
    'Then she asks whether you want to hear something weird.\n\n' +
    'A guest called Adrian Vale checked out this morning at ten past eight. The problem is that she saw his blue equipment bag locked inside the watersports shed at half past nine, which means the resort’s own records are wrong about where he is. She has told nobody else, and she is watching your face to see what you do with it.\n\n' +
    'Nobody has reported him missing, the tide fills the eastern caves twice a day, and on Sunday morning you get on a ferry either way. If you decide this is not your week for it, that is a real answer, and the island will simply carry on being the best place you have ever stayed.',

      'Aster Cove is an adults-only resort island forty minutes by fast ferry from Kagetsu. Everybody in this world is an adult and the player is between twenty-one and twenty-nine.',
      'Adrian Vale fell from a service ledge above east cove two nights before the player arrived, during a struggle over his camera with assistant manager Eli Mercer. Eli did not go there intending to hurt him.',
      'Adrian is alive on a tidal shelf in the sea cave beneath east cove, with a broken wrist, a deep leg cut, concussion symptoms and an old maintenance cache of water and first aid. He can die if enough time passes.',
      'Eli faked the checkout: the room, the bill, the ferry log, a distant camera shot of somebody in Adrian’s hat, the phone left by the pool, the blue bag in the watersports shed. He does not know whether Adrian survived.',
      'Eight years ago the parent company stored industrial solvent barrels in the east cove sea caves after a mainland logistics emergency. At least two ruptured. A contracted dive worker became ill and the matter was settled quietly. The contamination is localised: the rest of the island and its water are genuinely fine.',
      'Sora was near east cove the night Adrian fell, meeting Luka Reyes, and heard two male voices and an impact. She hid it because the area is restricted, because Luka could be fired, and because she was embarrassed. She does not know a crime happened.',
      'Nothing in this world is supernatural. The pink tide is bioluminescent plankton, the lighthouse is not haunted, and there is no cult, no serial killer and no secret order.',
      'Phones, wifi and ferries work. The mystery survives technology; it does not depend on a dead zone.',

      'The horror is daylight horror. A bloodstain under a white cabana at nine in the morning while somebody twenty feet away orders mango pancakes, a security camera pointed politely away, a key that stops working for four hours. Nothing lurks. ' +
      'Everybody here is escaping something and almost none of it is the crime: debt behind an influencer’s brand, a surgeon whose spouse left him a fortnight before the anniversary trip, a dive instructor running unauthorised dawn dives for cash. A lie is not a confession. ' +
