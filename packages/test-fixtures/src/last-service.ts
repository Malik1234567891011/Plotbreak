/**
 * "Last Service" — thirty seats, thirty days, and a hood that is making a noise.
 *
 * The bible's structural rule is the one that keeps this from becoming a
 * tournament: **not every important cooking scene is a competition.** Feeding a
 * sick friend, staff meal, teaching somebody to chop an onion, the dish you
 * make after a bad loss. If every plate gets scored, food stops being food. So
 * the City Table is the strongest default pressure and is explicitly not the
 * only route, and several of the best steps in this world have no winner in
 * them at all.
 *
 * The second thing it is careful about: the central question changes underneath
 * the player. It starts as "save Akari" and becomes "what does save actually
 * mean", and Keiko — who has run it for nineteen years and equates closing with
 * betraying her family — is the reason. Closing it deliberately, after a good
 * last night, is an authored ending with as much weight as keeping it open.
 *
 * Three variables. Hands is the only GOOD_HIGH, because a cook's hands are
 * genuinely what runs out and sleep is genuinely what returns them. Talk is
 * first among the descending pair: the generic cost path and PUBLIC_VIOLENCE
 * both take the first GOOD_LOW in array order, and a scene in a dining room
 * becoming something the city discusses is exactly the right consequence — and
 * attention is dangerous rather than good for a thirty-seat room that cannot
 * physically serve the covers it would bring.
