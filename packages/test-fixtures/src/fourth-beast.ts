/**
 * "The Fourth Beast" — Paris, and three small creatures in open habitats.
 *
 * The bible's structural instruction is that the starter choice is one of the
 * earliest meaningful decisions in the story and has to create ownership
 * immediately. So it is the archetype: the beast you pick is what you can do,
 * which is the honest mapping, and the opening scene is the first thirty
 * seconds with it rather than a menu.
 *
 * The beasts are deliberately not in `characters`, for the same reason White
 * Maw is not in Primal Crown's: they are animals. A `CharacterDef` carries
 * `voiceSamples`, and the moment a creature has quotable dialogue it stops
 * being a partner and becomes a person in a costume. They reach the writer
 * through the archetypes, the abilities that are theirs alone, hard canon and
 * the world's own hidden state instead.
 *
 * The playable span is the weeks between the lab and whatever Lucien is
 * building under the city. Elsewhere is real, it is never explained, and a run
 * that never goes below the quarries is a complete run.
 *
 * Three variables. Breath is the only GOOD_HIGH, because `resolveRest` refills
 * those and running across a city is the honest thing for that to mean.
 * Exposure is first among the descending pair: the generic cost path and
 * PUBLIC_VIOLENCE both take the first GOOD_LOW in array order, and an
 * impossible animal being seen doing something impossible in a crowded street
 * is exactly what that should feed.

  hook: 'A man in a pale coat has been killing people in Paris for six months and nothing anybody has shot him with has touched him, and a biologist has grown three animals that can.',
  premise:
    'For six months somebody has been taking people off the streets of Paris, and the city has learned to walk past the candles.\n\n' +
    'The footage is useless. A man in a pale coat, moving faster than the cameras record, and rounds that do not land on him at close range. The police have stopped offering theories in public.\n\n' +
    'A biologist at a private institute got hold of tissue from one of the scenes. It was alive, it was not human, and it was not anything else either. So he grew three animals out of it, because whatever is protecting that man is biological, and he believes only biology gets through it.\n\n' +
    'The animals need a person. Not an owner — a nervous system that matches theirs closely enough to keep them stable when things get bad. He found two people in the whole city who fit.\n\n' +
    'You are one of them. The other is a twenty-one-year-old whose brother went missing three months ago and who has been looking for him without waiting for anybody’s permission.\n\n' +
    'There are three creatures in that room and you are choosing first. She gets the second. The third stays where it is.\n\n' +
    'You need to work out what you have taken on quickly, because it takes about three weeks for the man in the pale coat to notice that somebody in this city can finally hurt him.',

      'Paris has had six months of linked abductions and attacks. Conventional weapons have repeatedly failed against the man responsible.',
      'Étienne Morel grew three creatures — Aurel, Nox and Marea — from tissue recovered at an attack scene. They are not clones and they are not the same animal.',
      'The creatures destabilise under extreme stress unless they are neurologically synchronised with a compatible person. Morel found exactly two: the player and Camille Laurent.',
      'Camille’s older brother Théo disappeared three months before the story starts, near one of the sites.',
      'Lucien Marot is responsible for the abductions. He has a fourth creature, Alba, which Morel did not make and which is where the tissue came from.',
      'Alba is not Lucien’s instrument. It chooses, it observes, it can disobey him, and it is genuinely attached to him.',
      'An adjacent ecology exists in some form. It is never fully explained and the story does not owe anybody an explanation of it.',

    toneGuide:
      'Contemporary Paris, lived-in rather than postcard: Métro platforms, apartment courtyards, bakeries at six in the morning, scooters, hospital corridors, a canal lock, a stairwell that smells of damp. Landmarks become extraordinary because something impossible is moving through them. ' +
      'The creature is an animal. It is hungry, it is bored, it is frightened of the escalator, it steals a croissant, it puts its head on your knee at exactly the wrong moment. Charm carries as much weight as danger. ' +
      'Lucien has ordinary conversations. He is patient, curious, likes animals more than most people, and is never once written screaming. ' +
      'Chases have real geography: Métro entrance, narrow street, roof, courtyard, bridge. Name the streets. ' +
      'Violence has consequences in a city with forty thousand phones in it, and hiding a creature the size of a dog that glows is a genuine recurring problem rather than a joke.',
