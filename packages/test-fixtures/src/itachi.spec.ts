/**
 * Itachi, held to the two promises that are specific to it, plus the class of
 * failure that no catalog-wide test can see.
 *
 * Promise one: canon is a gravity well and never a rail. A world built out of
 * a famous life fails in a way no other world here can — by quietly restoring
 * the shape it is supposed to let the player break. Every event that recreates
 * a famous beat is therefore checked for a cancelling condition, and the
 * famous ending is checked for being genuinely expensive to reach rather than
 * being where a passive run lands.
 *
 * Promise two: eight recognisable people who do not blur. This is the largest
 * cast in the catalog and the one where a shared voice would be most obvious,
 * so the voice check here is not a spot check for one construction — it
 * compares every pair.
