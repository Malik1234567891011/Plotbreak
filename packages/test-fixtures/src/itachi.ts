/**
 * "Itachi" — one fortnight out of a life that took seventeen years.
 *
 * The bible spans age four to death and reanimation: 15,554 words, a hundred
 * numbered sections, and the whole of the Third Shinobi World War at one end
 * and the Fourth at the other. A `StoryVersion` has one clock, one set of
 * locations and one cast at one set of ages, so the authoring decision that
 * had to be made first was where the *playable* world starts and what the rest
 * of the life becomes.
 *
 * The playable world is the coup crisis. Thirteen years old, ANBU captain,
 * Shisui still alive, Sasuke seven and knowable, Fugaku and Mikoto both in the
 * house, Danzo active and killable, Hiruzen reachable with evidence, the
 * massacre not yet demanded of anybody. The bible itself says this is the best
 * phase for this product (§55) and that the massacre must not arrive fast
 * (§257), and every one of the ten alternate lifelines it names (§135) is a
 * decision that gets made inside this fortnight. Twelve days, and every famous
 * thing downstream of them is contingent on what happens here.
 *
 * Everything before it is memory. The battlefield at four is the archetype
 * choice — §8 asks for an "early war belief" stored at the start and read back
 * by Shisui, Fugaku, Danzo and Hiruzen later, which is exactly what a build
 * option is. The Academy, the genin team, Tenma, the Sharingan, ANBU entry and
 * Mukai are `knowledgeScope`, item lore and the things people bring up.
 *
 * Everything after it is endings. Akatsuki, the cloak, Kisame, the illness,
 * the hotel corridor, the final fight, Edo Tensei — those are what a
 * destination *means*, not a phase the player grinds through. "The Shadow"
 * carries nine canon years in its epilogue, which is the right amount of room
 * for a route this world exists to let you refuse.
 *
 * Four variables, all invisible. Reserve is the one honest GOOD_HIGH, because
 * `resolveRest` refills those and a world with none tells the player they slept
 * and changes nothing. Clan Pressure is first in the descending order on
 * purpose: the generic cost path and PUBLIC_VIOLENCE both take the first
 * GOOD_LOW in array order, and an Uchiha seen fighting in the street raising
 * the temperature of the Uchiha question is exactly the right thing for that
 * to hit.
