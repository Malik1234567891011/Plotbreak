/**
 * "Second Skin" — sixteen, one choice, and a woman who has made it twice.
 *
 * The bible's most important design rule is that the first Affinity has to feel
 * enormous *before* the story admits it may not be final. So it is the
 * archetype: six shapes, chosen at the Heartstone, and every one of them
 * changes what the player can do, how the city reads them and what their
 * clothes are cut for. Nothing in the opening hours undercuts that.
 *
 * The second thing the bible is careful about is that the institution is not an
 * evil church. The Concord has prevented an enormous number of deaths, the
 * Seal was genuine emergency medicine after a genuine catastrophe, and most of
 * its people are helping. Its secret is that extracted secondary Echo energy
 * has quietly become load-bearing for ageing Heartstones, which means the
 * people it calls sick are keeping the cities standing. That is a material
 * incentive rather than a villain, and it is much harder to fight.
 *
 * The playable span is the Choosing and the weeks after it, in one city. The
 * capital, the ward under it and Kaia's brother are the far end of the map and
 * a run that never leaves Larkspire is a complete run.
 *
 * Three variables. Stamina is the only GOOD_HIGH. Suspicion is first among the
 * descending pair, because the generic cost path and PUBLIC_VIOLENCE both take
 * the first GOOD_LOW in array order and a sixteen-year-old doing something
 * impossible in a market street bringing the Wardens closer is exactly right.
 * Pull is the one the world is about: what the sealed shapes do when they are
 * asked to come back.

    'Everybody knows one body holds one shape. Everybody knows a second one is an illness that takes your mind or kills you, and there is a whole institution that treats the people it happens to, and it has been doing that for seven hundred years.\n\n' +
    'At the ceremony that evening a window comes in and a woman drops into the hall with wardens behind her. She has snow-leopard ears and a long spotted tail, and black feathers come up her left forearm while four hundred people are watching.\n\n' +
    'She is not here for you. She is here for something underneath this building, so by the end of the night you need to decide what you are going to say you saw.',
