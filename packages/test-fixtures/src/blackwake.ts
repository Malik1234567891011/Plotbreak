/**
 * "Blackwake" — a broken ship, a torn map, and nobody knowing your name.
 *
 * The design problem with a pirate fantasy is that the crew is usually
 * equipment. Here every crew member is a persistent character with their own
 * goals, their own opinions about each other, and a real ability to refuse,
 * leave, or hand you to the navy. Recruiting somebody is a relationship gate,
 * not a purchase, and keeping them is an ongoing cost.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately separate. Notoriety is how known your name is —
 * it opens doors, recruits people and gets you into rooms. The navy's opinion
 * of you is a different number entirely, and it goes down for things that have
 * nothing to do with how strong you are. A famous explorer with a huge bounty
 * and a nobody with none are both coherent characters.
 *
 * Relics each break exactly one rule of the world and nothing else, and a
 * player who never touches one can still become the most dangerous person in
 * the Blackwake through weapons, tactics and a very good crew.
 *
 * Parsed at import so a malformed world fails the build, not a player's session.

  hook: 'Your guardian spent forty years looking for a sea that is not on any map. Somebody killed him for it and left you the compass.',
  premise:
    'The Blackwake is nine hundred miles of open water and about four hundred islands, and every one of them belongs to somebody: the Ninth Fleet, a merchant house, a king, or whoever last held it long enough to say so.\n\n' +
    'Ferro Vane raised you. He spent his life looking for a region of ocean called the Crownless Sea that most people are quite sure does not exist, and he was laughed out of every port on the coast for it.\n\n' +
    'Eleven days ago somebody came into the workshop and cut his throat, and did not take his money.\n\n' +
    'He left you three things: a forty-year-old cutter with a cracked keel and no crew, the eastern third of a chart with the rest torn away, and a brass compass that points somewhere no compass points.\n\n' +
    'You are in Saltmarket harbour with a ship you cannot sail alone, and the only person who has offered to help is a navigator with a warrant out on her who will not say why she can read your guardian’s handwriting.\n\n' +
    'Nobody knows your name yet.',
