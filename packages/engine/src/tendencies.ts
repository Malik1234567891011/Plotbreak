/**
 * Spec §12.10 — what you keep doing, and who has noticed.
 *
 * Two features that are normally built as separate systems are the same piece
 * of state here, because they are the same question asked twice.
 *
 * A sports story wants a player's identity to emerge from play rather than
 * from a stat allocation screen: you become an isolation scorer because you
 * kept isolating, not because you put points into it. That needs a count of
 * what you did.
 *
 * The same story wants opponents to figure you out — the loop that makes
 * sports fiction work is discover a strength, dominate with it, get scouted,
 * evolve, come back. That needs a count of what you did, plus a record of who
 * has been watching.
 *
 * So: `tend:<id>` counts habits, `scout:<characterId>:<id>` counts what one
 * opponent has worked out, and both live in flags, which already hold numbers
 * and already persist through a reload, a fork and a replay.
 *
 * The design rule this is built to enforce is the user's: an opponent who has
 * "learned you" must be a number that changes a roll, never a line of prose
 * asserting it happened.
