 *
 * The memory of an attack is stored, retrieved and present in the writer's
 * prompt — verified end to end — and the adversarial sweep kept catching the
 * writer treating it as one optional line among a dozen things a character
 * knows. So on every turn aimed at somebody the player has attacked, it stops
 * being background and becomes an instruction.
