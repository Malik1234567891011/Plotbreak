/**
 * Spec §11.9 — the world the player made, composed over the world an author
 * wrote.
 *
 * The problem this solves in one sentence: a published `StoryVersion` is
 * immutable and shared, so anything the story invents for one player has
 * nowhere to live. A café the writer conjured on the way out of the academy
 * read beautifully and was gone by the next session, because it had never been
 * anywhere but a paragraph.
 *
 * The shape of the fix is composition rather than mutation. Generated
 * definitions live on the session; `composeStory` merges them over the
 * authored ones at the top of each entry point; and the forty places in the
 * engine that look up `story.characters` keep working unchanged. A promoted
 * NPC is a character in every sense the engine has — you can travel to their
 * shop, talk to them, build a relationship, fight them, and kill them.
 *
 * Promotion is the interesting half. Everything the writer invents starts
 * ephemeral, and stays ephemeral: three students in a hallway do not need
 * three permanent records. It becomes real when the player treats it as real —
 * goes there, talks to them, comes back looking for them.
