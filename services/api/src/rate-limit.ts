/**
 * Spec §31.7 — rate limits by user, device and IP.
 *
 * The turn endpoint spends money on every call. Without a limit, one client
 * with a loop can drain the model budget faster than any dashboard will notice,
 * and a signed-out caller can do it without an account at all.
 *
 * A sliding window rather than a fixed one: a fixed window lets a caller send
 * the whole allowance at 59 seconds and the whole allowance again at 61, which
 * is exactly the burst the limit exists to stop.
 *
 * In-process, because the product launches as one API instance and a limiter
 * that pretends to be distributed while being per-instance is worse than one
 * that is honest about it. `RateLimiter` is an interface so a Redis or Postgres
 * implementation can replace it without touching a route.
