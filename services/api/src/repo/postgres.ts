/**
 * The production persistence adapter (spec §34, §35).
 *
 * Everything a run consists of lives in Postgres: the profile, the session, the
 * authoritative game state and every snapshot behind it, the turn log, the
 * append-only event log, memory, the wallet ledger, idempotency keys and the
 * social and safety tables. Restarting the API, redeploying it, or signing in
 * on a different phone changes nothing a player can see.
 *
 * Two rules the schema enforces rather than trusting the code to remember:
 *
 * 1. `saveState` is a compare-and-set on `story_sessions.revision`. Two turns
 *    racing on the same session cannot both commit; the loser gets `false` and
 *    the route turns that into a 409 with the current revision (§17.4).
 * 2. `wallet_ledger` is append-only with a unique index on
 *    (account_id, idempotency_key), so a retried purchase or grant can be
 *    written twice and credited once (§20.7).
 *
 * State is stored as one jsonb document per revision rather than shredded
 * across the normalised runtime tables. The document is the authority and it is
 * read whole every turn; the normalised tables exist for analytics, and a
 * mapper that had to keep eight tables in step with one contract would drift
 * the first time somebody added a field.
