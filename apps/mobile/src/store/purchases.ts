/**
 * The native purchase flow (spec §20.6, §33.5).
 *
 * StoreKit and Play Billing decide whether money moved. This module's only job
 * is to open the sheet, hand what the store gives us to our server, and finish
 * the transaction once the server says the credits landed.
 *
 * The rule everything here is arranged around:
 *
 *   A transaction is never finished until the server has credited it.
 *
 * An unfinished consumable is redelivered by StoreKit on every launch, so a
 * purchase that Apple took and our server never heard about comes back by
 * itself. Finishing early to make an error go away is how a player pays and
 * gets nothing, so this code would rather retry forever than do that.
 *
 * The module is loaded lazily and degrades to unavailable in Expo Go, which has
 * no billing native module. Everything above still runs; the store just says it
 * cannot open.
