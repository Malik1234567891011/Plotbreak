            Earlier beats used to sit behind an "↑ Earlier beats" button and
            then render at 55% opacity, which made the last hour of play look
            like an appendix and made the screen feel like a set of active
            nodes rather than a story you can read back. It is one feed now,
            and scrolling up is how you reread it. */}

          Every committed turn except the one the live slot below is showing.

          `slice(0, -1)` alone was wrong, and wrong only while a turn was in
          flight. The last committed turn is normally drawn by the live slot,
          which is why it is cut here — but the moment the player submits,
          `pending` takes that slot over and the `!pending` guards below stop
          drawing `latest`. So for the length of the request the previous beat
          was in neither place: its prompt, its prose, its check and its hero
          frame all left the screen, and came back when the next turn committed.

          From the player's side that reads as the image moving: a frame sits
          under the line you just wrote, you send the next one, the frame
          disappears — and when it returns the feed has reflowed, so it looks
          like a new image appeared under the *earlier* prompt.

          While something is pending, nothing in `turns` is live any more, so
          all of it belongs to the history.
