 * current language, which would be a second source of truth alongside
 * `AppState.locale` and would have to be kept in step with it — and its `t` is
 * typed as `(key: string)`, so a misspelled key renders the key. Here
 * `Translator` is keyed by `TranslationKey`, which is derived from the English
 * catalogue, so a typo is a compile error and a key nobody uses is visible.
 *
 * **This is the interface language, not the open run's language.** A screen
 * rendering a French run's beats in an English app is correct: the run's locale
 * is frozen in `GameState.locale` and travels with the session. Use
 * `useSessionT` for anything that belongs to a particular run.
