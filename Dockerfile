# The API, containerised.

# Runs straight from TypeScript with `tsx`, which is what `npm start` already
# does — the packages have no build step and adding one for deployment would be
# a second way to be wrong about module resolution.
#
# Assets are the interesting part. `infra/seed/assets` is 3.2 GB on a dev
# machine, and almost none of it belongs in an image:
#
#   * `hero/` is 1803 runtime-generated turn images, 2.1 GB of playtest debris.
#   * The `.png` files are 3.0 GB and are sources; `/media/*` serves `.webp`
#     first and only falls back to `.png`.
#
# What actually ships is the world art as webp: 1225 files, 80 MB. See
# `.dockerignore`.
